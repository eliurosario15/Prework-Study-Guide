# Prework-Study-Guide

## A short but usefull guide for all students, present and future, that lists all the topics you'll be working on during your bootcamp.

As more students join our Berkeley bootcamp, we've noticed how challenging the first few weeks can be. We decided to come up with a study guide that students can review prior to starting their bootcamp experience. This will allow them to further search and study about the material they'll be working on. We hope this guide helps students get their feet in the exicting but challenging world of coding.
